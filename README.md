This repository contains the FishGlob database, including the methods to load, clean, and process 29 publicly available bottom trawl surveys from Europe and North America. This database is a product of the CESAB working group, [FishGlob: Fish biodiversity under global change – a worldwide assessment from scientific trawl surveys](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/fishglob/).

### Accessing final data products

Users can either:
- Use the single survey data products in **[outputs/Cleaned_data/](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/outputs/Cleaned_data)** and work with survey .RData files excluding standardization flags (SURVEYCODE.RData) or including standardization flags (SURVEYCODE_std_clean.RData; see **Survey data standardization and flags** below for more information on flagging); or
- Generate a compiled version of the data by running the **cleaning_codes/merge.R** which will write local versions of the database in **[outputs/Compiled_data/](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/blob/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/cleaning_codes/merge.R)**

* **[metadata_docs](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/metadata_docs)** has a README with notes about each survey. This is a place to document changes in survey methods, quirks, etc. It is a growing list. If you have information to add, please open an Issue.
* **[outputs](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/outputs)** contains all survey data processed .RData files and flagging outputs
* **[QAQC](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/QAQC)** contains the additional QAQC performed on surveys that required supplementary checks (DATRAS-sourced surveys)
* **[standard_formats](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/standard_formats)** includes definitions of file formats in the FishGlob database, including survey ID codes.
* **[standardization_steps](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/standardization_steps)** contains the R codes to run a full survey standardization and a cross-survey summary of flagging methods
* **[summary](https://github.com/fishglob/FishGlob_data/tree/869626af0e7df5c9bb8688673c3a3eb2a016e720/summary)** contains QAQC plots for each survey

### Survey data processing steps

Data processing and cleaning is done on a per survey basis unless formats are similar across a group of surveys. The current repository can process 29 scientific bottom-trawl surveys, according to the following steps.

*Survey data processing steps*
1. Merge the data files for one survey
2. Clean & homogenize column names following the format described in *standard_formats/fishglob_data_columns.xlsx*
3. Create missing columns and standardize units using the standard format *standard_formats/fishglob_data_columns.xlsx*
4. Integrate the cleaned taxonomy by applying the function *clean_taxa()* and apply expert knowledge on taxonomic treatments
5. Perform quality checks, including the output in the *summary* folder and specific QAQC for other surveys detailed in the QAQC folder

### Survey data standardization and flags

Data standardization and flags are done on a per survey basis and per survey_unit basis (integrating seasons and quarters). Flags are performed both on the temporal occurrence of taxa and the spatio-temporal sampling footprint according to the following steps.

*Survey data standardization and flagging steps*
1. Taxonomic quality control: run flag_spp() for each survey region
2. Apply methods to identify a standard spatial footprint through time for each survey-season/quarter (the survey_unit column). Use the functions apply_trimming_per_survey_unit_method1() and apply_trimming_per_survey_unit_method2() 
3. Display and integrate results in the summary files

### Updates policy

The FISHGLOB Steering Committee updates this database approximately once a year, to incorporate additional data from included surveys, and to continually improve the data pipeline. Every year (large) update will represent a new “Release” (as listed on [our releases page](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data/releases) - currently #4.) If critical errors are discovered the Steering Committee will update the database as quickly as is logistically feasible. Anyone re-using the FISHGLOB database who wants to request specific changes in future updates is welcome to open a GitHub Issue. 

#### :warning: Important updates :warning:

> **1/29/2025**: We are aware that there are some surveys that currently have 0 values for wgt and num based columns where they should have NAs, as described in [issue 47](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data/issues/47). We recommend that you look closely at the metadata for surveys you're using to see whether a 0 value in a column means 0, or means NA. We are currently working to resolve this issue.

> **5/06/2024**: A warning about CSVs
Datasets are available for download in **outputs/Cleaned_data/** as .Rdata files. *We do not recommend saving FishGlob data in .csv format.* For at least some surveys, the `haul_id` column is composed of a long string of numerics, which is incorrectly rounded if loaded from a .csv programmatically in R (with `read_csv()` or `read.csv()`). As documented in [issue #49](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data/issues/49), this leads to errors in the `haul_id` column, and may occur regardless of the "class" assigned to this column. The most robust way to prevent this error is to write to / read from other data types such as .Rdata or .rds. Packages exist for users to import these into Python and other programming languages. 

> **23/11/2023**: FishGlob_data v2.0. This fixes [issue #29](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data/issues/29).

> **05/09/2023**: Norwegian survey is erroneous and will be replaced with a Barents Sea centered survey over 2004-onwards which will change the spatio-temporal coverage of the region (coordinated by Laurene Pecuchet with IMR), see [issue #29](https://github.com/AquaAuma/FishGlob_data/issues/29)
